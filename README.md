# Head in the Clouds

Head in the Clouds is an Endless Runner type game made in unity. Avoid obstacles, collect powerups, survive endless levels to beat your previous runs. 

This was a fun learning experience, and as a first try I'm really happy with the way it turned out. I plan to continue to iron out the bugs and add extra features for another month or so, both to give myself more practice and to make a complete product I am satisfied with.

*Used unity v 2020.2.2f1*
